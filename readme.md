# Tutorial: Intro to React

Referenced from the [ReactJS Docs.](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) This tutorial doesnâ€™t assume any existing React knowledge.

## To Start

### Setup Option 1: Write Code in the Browser
This is the quickest way to get started!

First, open this [Starter Code](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0010) in a new tab. The new tab should display an empty tic-tac-toe game board and React code. We will be editing the React code in this tutorial.

### Setup Option 2: Local Development Environment
This is completely optional and not required for this tutorial!

If you want to follow along the demo on your local device, please do the following:
1. Navigate to the "my-app" folder.
2. Execute `npm install` on the "my-app" folder.
3. Once the installation is done, run `npm start` on the same folder.
4. You should see an empty tic-tac-toe field when you open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser. You are now ready to follow along!

### Accessing Stepped Solutions

Each numbered folder in `stepped-solutions` contains the files for the beginning of each correspondingly numbered video, should you need them. So, if you need any code, pull the appropriate file into your `starter-files` folder.
